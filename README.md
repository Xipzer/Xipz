### Hello There üß†
Welcome to my GitHub. I'm your friendly neighbourhood ```~Xipzer``` üíé

I've been a solo-act DeFi Developer since 2021. I'm a Universal Dev, equipped to rapidly adapt to and produce any given commission.

### Need a Xipz in your life? üÜò

Are you in trouble? Need a quick and sexy solution to revive your project? Look no further.

I'm adept at both OOP and Functional Programming Languages, though the latter wouldn't typically concern DeFi. I can learn a new language within minutes.

Some of my works can be found showcased at the following (predominantly works that include a visual element):
- Twitter: https://x.com/xipzer
- Telegram: https://t.me/XipzDevDungeon

For obvious reasons, I don't publicly expose codebases produced for customers. Hence, my repositories are almost exclusively private. However, I will happily redeploy past projects/products for demo-purposes. 

I can be reached at the following:
- Twitter: https://x.com/xipzer <- <i>Ehh 50/50</i>
- Telegram: https://t.me/Xipzer <- <b><i>Where I'm typically reached</i></b>
- Email: xipzer@proton.me <- <i>I will virtually never check this</i>
